# In the card, "#", "%" and the pair of "{" and "}" are used for commenting, prompting and grouping, respectively.

# The following six items are indispensable, and they can't be removed or left empty.

# One file per line without tailing characters, such as comma, semicolon and period. In addition, wildcards "[]?*" are supported in the item just like in the method Add() of the class TChain. Besides, both the absolute and relative paths are supported in the item.
