Main Page {#mainpage}
============================================================

This is the class documentation of the *BOSS Afterburner* repository. These pages are meant to help make sense of the class structure of both the **initial event selection packages** (a base-derived algorithm framework) and of the framework that can be used for the **final event selection** and for plotting and fitting event selection results.

To get an idea of the structure of this repository, you can best have a look in the <a href="modules.html">Modules section</a> or the <a href="hierarchy.html">Class Hierarchy</a>.

For the tutorial pages on BOSS and the *BOSS Afterburner*, go to the [GitBook page of this repository](https://besiii.gitbook.io/boss). For the repository itself, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/redeboer/BOSS_IniSelect).
